3. **Pricing model**: Free, freemium, paid tiers, open-source, enterprise -- verify by reading their pricing page with WebFetch
4. **Key features**: What they do well
5. **Weaknesses**: What users complain about (search "[competitor] problems" or "[competitor] alternative")
6. **Market signals**: GitHub stars, npm downloads, funding rounds, employee count, press mentions
7. **Differentiation**: What they do that the target application doesn't, and vice versa

Search queries to try:
- "[category] tools 2026"

## Output Format

Return findings as structured markdown with clear headers. Include:
- Specific names, numbers, and URLs for every claim
- Direct quotes where available

- **Sources** section at the end with all URLs referenced

Every finding must be specific and sourced. If you cannot find data on a topic, say so explicitly rather than filling with speculation.

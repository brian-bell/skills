# skills

Central repo for personal AI skills.

Portable skills live as top-level directories and are symlinked into both:

- `~/.agents/skills/<skill>`
- `~/.claude/skills/<skill>`

Claude-native skills live under `claude-native/`.

## Portable Skills

- `commit` — Create clean local-only git commits without pushing.
- `chrome-reading-list` — Export Chrome Reading List data to CSV/JSON.
- `docs` — Update `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/` from source truth.
- `grill-me` — Stress-test a plan or design through one-question-at-a-time interview.
- `improve-codebase-architecture` — Find module-deepening opportunities.
- `prd-to-issues` — Break a PRD into vertical-slice GitHub issues.
- `prd-to-plan` — Turn a PRD into a phased tracer-bullet implementation plan.
- `product-manager` — Codex-compatible product and market analysis workflow.
- `review-loop` — Iterative worker/reviewer quality loop.
- `ship` — Commit, push, and open/reuse a PR.
- `skill-parity-audit` — Compare skill roots for missing, drifted, and broken skills.
- `tdd` — Test-driven development with red/green/refactor loops.
- `work-prs` — Process open non-draft PRs with complete checks, fix failures/blockers, and push targeted fixes.
- `write-a-prd` — Interview, design, and draft a PRD as a GitHub issue.

`rebase` is intentionally not a skill. The old `commands/` layer is retired.

- `claude-native/go-review-team/` — Claude `/go-review` skill plus Go reviewer agents.
